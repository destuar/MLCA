# Housing Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a housing dataset, focusing on exploring various aspects such as house prices, quality, year built, and other key features. The analysis includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and modeling to understand the factors influencing house prices.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels

## File Descriptions
- `CA01.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.

## How to Run
Open the `CA01.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Analysis Summary
The notebook starts with data loading and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we visualize distributions and relationships between different variables. We then perform more detailed analysis, including creating heatmaps, pair plots, and bar plots, to understand deeper insights into the housing market.

## Results and Insights
The analysis reveals interesting insights into the housing market, such as the impact of overall quality and neighborhood on sale prices, and the relationship between house features like year built, basement size, and overall quality with the sale price.

## Future Work
Future analysis could include predictive modeling to forecast house prices based on various features and further exploration of other variables not covered in this analysis.
