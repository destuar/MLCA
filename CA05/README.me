   - Implementation of the KNN algorithm.
   - Selection of features and distance metrics.

4. **Evaluation and Comparison**
   - Using distance measures to find the nearest neighbors.
   - Analysis of the top 5 movies similar to "The Post."

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
   - Insights on the effectiveness of KNN for movie recommendations.
   - Discussion on the potential of KNN in recommendation systems.

## Objective

The primary goal of this notebook is to showcase the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in identifying movies similar to a given movie, "The Post," based on its genre and rating. This analysis serves as a foundational step towards building a recommendation system that can suggest movies to users based on their preferences.

## Data Usage

The analysis utilizes a dataset comprising movie titles, genres, and ratings. The dataset includes a diverse range of movies, among which "The Post" is used as the reference point for finding similar movies.

## How to Use

To replicate this analysis:
- Ensure Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab is installed on your system.
- Download the `CA05.ipynb` notebook file.
- Launch Jupyter and open the downloaded notebook.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
- A basic understanding of K-Nearest Neighbors and recommendation systems.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes that the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a powerful tool for building recommendation systems, especially in domains like movie suggestions. The analysis identified 5 movies similar to "The Post," demonstrating how genre and rating can serve as effective features for movie recommendations. This approach can be extended to incorporate more features and fine-tune recommendations.
